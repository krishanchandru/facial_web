Project Title: Facial Recognition Login System

Project Overview:-
I developed a Facial Recognition Login System that combines email/password authentication with facial recognition for secure user login. 
Users can register with their email, password, and a facial image, and log in using the same credentials along with real-time facial verification. 
This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, computer vision, and creating seamless user experiences.

Key Features:-
* User Registration: Users register with email, password, and a facial image captured via webcam.
* User Login:Users log in with email, password, and real-time facial verification.
* Facial Recognition: Uses Mediapipe for face detection and OpenCV for image processing.
* Responsive Design: Modern, colorful, and user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Backend: Built with Flask for handling registration, authentication, and image processing.

How It Works:-

Registration: Users provide email, password, and a facial image. The backend processes and stores the data.

Login: Users log in with email, password, and a real-time facial image. The backend verifies the image against the stored one.

Success Pages: Users are redirected to "Registration Successful" or "Login Successful" pages after completing the process.
